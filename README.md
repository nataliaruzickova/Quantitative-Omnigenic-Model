## by Ruzickova, Hledik & Tkacik

Code to the publication *Quantitative omnigenic model discovers interpretable genome-wide associations* by Ruzickova, Hledik & Tkacik (PNAS 2024) available at https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2402340121 or https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.01.578486v1.

Code for running and evaluating the Quantitative omnigenic models (QOM) 0th-3rd order, QOM bound and polygenic risk score (PRS) model; as well as code for shuffling regulatory networks to test their predictive power. QOM is run on using genotypes and expression levels of a yeast cross population data by Albert et al (2018), https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35471.
